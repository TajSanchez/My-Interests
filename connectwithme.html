            Excited To Learn
         </h3>
         <strong>   <p>
           I am really excited to learn about web development. I'm glad that I'm able to experience this, to be able to create something from strach is very nice. Creativy is one of the reasons that web development caught my eye. It makes me feel very accomplished and proud when I finish a project. I can't wait to see how far I can take my creativity.

       <strong><p>Two FBI agent brothers, Marcus (Marlon Wayans) and Kevin Copeland (Shawn Wayans), accidentally foil a drug bust. As punishment, they are forced to escort a pair of socialites (Maitland Ward, Anne Dudek) to the Hamptons, where they're going to be used as bait for a kidnapper.
