                popularity brought him back as a main character, One of Hiei's strongest techniques, where he calls upon
                the black flames of the demon realm and shapes them into a dragon before firing them at the opponent.
                This attack is very hard to control, but the flames it is made up of can reduce even a demon's body to
                ashes in one shot.</td>

                and signature attack, which has him fire a blast of spirit energy from his finger like a bullet. It can
                be fired an almost unlimited amount of times, as long as Yusuke has energy. By firing it with both
                fingers, its power greatly increases. Spirit Wave: Yusuke channels all of his spirit energy and releases
                it through either a physical attack or an energy blast, dealing incredible damage to whoever he hits. It
                is much stronger at close-range. </td>

                fight until he met Yusuke.</td>

                a similar sound effect to the lightsaber weapon of the Star Wars franchise. Spirit Sword (霊剣, Rei Ken,
                Aura Sword in the Viz translation): This is Kuwabara's signature attack, where he creates a sword
                comprised only of his Spirit Energy. Its strength depends on how much energy Kuwabara focuses into it.
                His name, Kazuma, means peace and truth.
